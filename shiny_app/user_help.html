    <h4>To calculate the retention indices of your compounds, go through following steps:</h4>
   
    <ol>
      <li>Download the data-upload Template</li>
      <li>Fill in the retention time of your alkane standards </li>
      <li>Fill in the retention time of your compounds of interest </li>
      <li>Upload the template containing your data </li>
      <li>Check the plot showing your alkane series for irregularities</li>
      <li>Download your data containing the results</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 1: Download the data-upload template</h3>
    <p>If you're using this tool for the fist time, start downloading upload-template. This Excel file contains two tabs in which you enter and upload your data, explained below. The template already contains some example data. You can remove these and enter your own. 
    <br></br>
    <i> NOTE: This tool may occasionally be updated. If the template is not working properly anymore, please download again. </i>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Fill in the retention time of your alkane standards </h3>
      <p>Use the <b>first tab</b> of the template document ("Alkane_Series") to enter the retention time of your alkanes. The first column ('name') should contain the name of each alkane. The second column ('carbons') contains the number of carbon atoms of the alkane. The third column ('retention_time') contains the retention time of the alkane that you measured. The retention time can be minutes or seconds. Only use the alkanes that you've actually measured; remove the ones from the template that are not in your series.</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Fill in the retention time of your compounds of interest </h3>
      <p>Use the <b>second tab</b> tab of the upload template ('Compounds_of_interest') to enter the retention time of your compounds of interest. Give every compound a unique identifier in the fist column ('compound_id'). This ID is fully arbitrairy, and serves solily as an identifier for the user. Enter the measured retention time in the second column ('retention_time'). Make sure you use the same time-unit (i.e. seconds or minutes) as you used in your alkane series. 
      <br></br>
      NOTE: The retention time of your compounds must be within the range of the retention times of your alkane series.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Upload the template containing your data </h3>
  <p>Save the filled Excel template on your computer (".xlsx") and upload the file by clicking the <i> "Browse..." </i> button. After data-upload, the results will automatically be displayed in the <b>Results</b> window of this tool </p>
  
  <h3>Step 5: Check the alkane series for irregularities</h3>
   <p>Before jumping to the results, take a moment to examine the plot of retention times for your alkanes. The line should be smooth when using a constant ramping temperature (see below). If there are any irregularities, it is possible that you made a mistake, such as accidentally switching or skipping an alkane. Be sure to double-check the file you uploaded, or refer back to the chromatogram of your alkane series if necessary. </p>

    <h3>Step 6: Download the results </h3>
   <p>After uploading your data, you will see a preview of the results in a table below the plot of the alkane series. This tool will calculate the Kovats Retention Index (KI) and the Arithmetic Index (AI) for your compounds of interest. The KI is calculated using the formula proposed by Kovats (1965) and is suitable for use when the temperature of the GC-column is constant. However, as noted by Van den Dool and Kratz (1963), when temperature-ramping is used on the GC-column, the AI is a more appropriate choice. For more details; see the KI / AI INFO window.
