    <p>To calculate the retention indices of your compounds, follow the following steps:</p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Download the data-upload Template</li>
      <li>Fill in the retention time of your alkane standards </li>
      <li>Fill in the retention time of your compounds of interest </li>
      <li>Upload the template containing your data </li>
      <li>Check the plot showing your alkane standards for irregularities</li>
      <li>Download your data containing the results</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 1: Download the data-upload template</h3>

    <h3>Step 2: Fill in the retention time of your alkane standards </h3>
      <p>Use the <b>first tab</b> of the template document ("Alkane_Series") to enter the retention time of your alkanes. The first column ('name') should contain the name of each alkane. The second column ('carbons') contains the number of carbon atoms of the alkane. The third column ('retention_time') contains the retention time of the alkane that you measured. The retention time can be minutes or seconds. Only use the alkanes that you've actually measured; remove the ones from the template that are not in your series.</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Fill in the retention time of your compounds of interest </h3>
      <p>Use the <b>second tab</b> to enter the retention time of your compounds of interest. </p>
