    <h3>Kovats Retention index (KI)</h3>
    <p>The Kovats Retention Index (KI) is a measure for the retention of a compound on a chromatography column. This can be calculated using the formula proposed by Kovats (1965) and is based on the retention times of a reference compounds. Here, we use a series of alkanes as a reference.

    In this tool, the KI is calculated similarly as done by Adams (2007):

    <ul>
      <li>RT(x) retention time of the compound of interest </li>
      <li>RT(P<sub>z</sub>) retention time of the alkane before RT(x) </li>
      <li>RT(P<sub>z+1</sub>) retention time of the alkane after RT(x) </li>
      <li>P<sub>z</sub> number of carbons of the alkane before RT(x) </li>
    </ul>
     </p>
     
    <h3>Arithmetic Index (AI)</h3>
    <p>The Arithmetic Index (AI) was proposed by Van den Dool and Kratz (1963) as a more suitable measure when the chromatography column undergoes temperature changes. When using CG-MS with an increasing column temperature ('ramping') it's advised to use the AI instead of the KI.
